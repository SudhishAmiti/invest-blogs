                    CRYPTO CURRENCY
                </div>
                <div class="s_text">
                    A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of
                    exchange through a computer
                    network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or
                    maintain it.It is a decentralized
                    system for verifying that the parties to a transaction have the money they claim to have,
                    eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries,
                    such as banks, when funds are being transferred between two entities. Cryptocurrency does not exist
                    in physical form (like paper money) and is typically
                    not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed
                    to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).When a
                    cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally
                    considered centralized. When implemented with
                    decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a
                    blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction
                    database.Traditional asset classes like currencies, commodities, and stocks, as well as
                    macroeconomic factors, have modest exposures to cryptocurrency returns.

                A stock is a general term used to describe the ownership certificates
                of any company. A share, on the other hand, refers to the stock certificate
                of a particular company. Holding a particular company's share makes you a shareholder.
                Stocks are of two typesâ€”common and preferred. The difference is while the holder of the
                former has voting rights that can be exercised in corporate decisions, the later doesn't.
                However, preferred shareholders are legally entitled to receive a certain level of dividend
                payments before any dividends can be issued to other shareholders.There is also something
                called 'convertible preferred stock'. This is basically a preferred stock with an option of
                converting into a fixed number of common shares, usually any time after a predetermined date.

                Real estate is considered real property that includes land and anything permanently attached

                which include residential, commercial, industrial, raw land, and special use.
                Investing in real estate includes purchasing a home, rental property, or land.
                Indirect investment in real estate can be made via REITs or through pooled real estate investment.

            A mutual fund is a financial vehicle that pools assets from shareholders to invest in securities like
            stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. Mutual funds are operated by professional
            money managers, who allocate the fund's assets and attempt to produce capital gains or income for the
            fund's investors. A mutual fund's portfolio is structured and maintained to match the investment
            objectives stated in its prospectus.

                    Will The Market Recover In 2023?
                </div>
                <div class="s_text">
                    Investors suffered a beatdown in 2022, with all three major indexes making their biggest declines since the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared the best, down 8.8% thanks to its relative underexposure to badly beaten technology stocks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite endured an ugly fall of more than 33%, while the S&P 500 sank 19.5%.
                    The year was even more challenging for growth stock investors. The Innovator IBD 50 ETF slumped around 50%, while the IBD Sector Leaders  plummeted a devastating 60%. In 2022, the "big is beautiful" theme was underlined by the IBD Big Cap 20 falling less than 7%.
                    The whippy action caused the IBD stock market outlook to switch from "confirmed uptrend" to "uptrend under pressure" and to "correction" several times in 2022. Investors who followed IBD's principles could have limited their losses in comparison to the indexes by following sell rules and paying close attention to the current market outlook to avoid overexposure..

                    Recession Risks In 2023 Stock Market Forecast
                </div>
                <div class="s_text">
                    A key economic question for the stock market forecast for 2023 is whether the U.S. will enter a recession as the Federal Reserve tries to cool inflation.
                    At the December Fed meeting, the central bank signaled it would raise its funds rate to a range as high as 5% to 5.25% in 2023.
                    One key issue is the strength of the labor market. It has held up despite rising rates, and wages have ticked higher even as they fail to keep pace with the overall cost of living.
                    Wells Fargo's Cronk points out other factors at play along with the fastest interest rate hikes since 1981.
                    "It's also quantitative tightening, the shrinking the balance sheet," he said. "It's the trade-weighted U.S. dollar up 12% to 15%, which tightens financial conditions. And it's the M2 money supply growth dropping from a run rate of 27% during the pandemic down to now negative."

                    Crypto scam of Rs 500 crores uncovered, victims duped with a promise of 200% returns

                <div class="s_text">
                According to the Delhi Police, the suspects took the investors on vacation to Goa and organised a grand event, where scamsters described the complex process of blockchain technology and answered potential investors' questions to later dupe them.
                On this, one of the victims revealed their intention to cheat investors with the false story of their upcoming cryptocurrency, whose value was claimed to be $2.5 by fraudsters.
                Aside from promising a 200 percent annual return on investment, the accused also promised 5-20 percent monthly returns, which would be credited to the investors' bank accounts on the 5th, 15th, or 25th of the month, according to one of the victims.

                </div>
                <div class="s_text">
                On the last trading day of 2022, Indian headline equity index Nifty charts today showed the formation of a dark cloud cover type candle pattern. Analysts say that having moved in a broader range of 18200-17950 levels in the last few sessions, the probability of further 
                consolidation is likely.Now, the index has to continue to hold above 18181 zones, for an up move towards 18350 and 18442 levels whereas supports are placed at 18081 and 18018 levels, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal.Option data suggests a broader trading range in 
                between 17700 to 18600 zones while an immediate trading range in between 17950 to 18400 zones

                <div class="s_text">
                    Tracking performance with appropriate benchmarks: It is important to analyse the mutual fund performance based on the fundâ€™s returns compared to an appropriate benchmark. A few examples of popular benchmarks include Nifty 50, which comprises the top 50 stocks by market capitalisation.
                    Large-cap funds have the Nifty 50 total return index (TRI) as the benchmark. 
                    BSE Sensex comprises the top 30 stocks by market capitalisation. As benchmark, large-cap funds track BSE Sensex TRI. 
                between 17700 to 18600 zones while an immediate trading range in between 17950 to 18400 zones
